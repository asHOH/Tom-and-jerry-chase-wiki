- **Type**: Next.js Application
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router architecture
- **React**: React 19 with TypeScript for type safety
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Language**: Chinese (zh-CN)
- **Architecture**: Client-side and Server-side (Next.js)
- **Security**: Standard Next.js security practices
- **Target Audience**: Chinese-speaking players of the Tom and Jerry Chase mobile game

## Core Features

- **Character Database**: Detailed information about cat and mouse characters including stats, skills, and recommended builds
- **Knowledge Cards**: Complete database of knowledge cards with effects and filtering capabilities
- **Search & Filter**: Advanced search and filtering system with Chinese pinyin support
- **Skill Point Calculator**: Tools for optimizing character skill allocations
- **Progressive Web App**: Offline-capable PWA with caching for mobile users

# Technology Stack

## Styling & UI

- **Tailwind CSS 4** for utility-first styling
- Custom design system with predefined color schemes for game elements
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

## State Management & Data

- **Valtio** for reactive state management
- **SWR** for data fetching and caching
- **Immer** for immutable state updates
- Static TypeScript data files for game content

## Development Tools

- **ESLint** with Next.js, Testing Library, and Storybook plugins
- **Prettier** for code formatting (single quotes, 100 char width)
- **Husky** for git hooks with pre-commit, pre-push validation

## Testing

- **Jest** with jsdom environment
- **React Testing Library** for component testing
- **Storybook** for component development and documentation

## Build & Deployment

- **Vercel** for hosting and deployment
- **PWA** capabilities with next-pwa and service worker
- **MDX** support for documentation

## Performance & Analytics

- **Vercel Analytics** and **Speed Insights**
- Image optimization and caching strategies
- Runtime caching for offline functionality

## Source Code Structure (`src/`)

### Core Directories

- **`app/`** - Next.js App Router pages and API routes
  - `api/` - Server-side API endpoints
  - `[feature]/` - Feature-based page routing (characters, cards, etc.)
  - Layout and metadata files

- **`components/`** - Reusable React components
  - `ui/` - Basic UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
  - `displays/` - Complex display components
  - Root-level utility components (ErrorBoundary, Analytics, etc.)

- **`data/`** - Game data and type definitions
  - Character data files (`catCharacters.ts`, `mouseCharacters.ts`)
  - Knowledge card data (`catKnowledgeCards.ts`, `mouseKnowledgeCards.ts`)
  - `types.ts` - TypeScript type definitions
  - `__tests__/` - Data validation tests

- **`lib/`** - Utility functions and business logic
  - Feature-specific utilities (`skillUtils.ts`, `filterUtils.ts`)
  - `searchUtils/` - Search functionality
  - `__tests__/` - Unit tests for utilities

- **`context/`** - React Context providers
  - `AppContext.tsx` - Global application state
  - `EditModeContext.tsx` - Edit mode functionality
  - `DarkModeContext.tsx` - Theme management

- **`constants/`** - Application constants and configuration

## Architecture Patterns

### Data Layer

- Static TypeScript files for game data
- Centralized type definitions in `data/types.ts`
- Validation through TypeScript strict mode

### Component Architecture

- Functional components with hooks
- Context for global state management
- Utility functions separated from components
- Custom hooks in `lib/` directory

### Feature Organization

- Feature-based routing in `app/` directory
- Shared components in `components/`
- Feature-specific utilities in `lib/`
- Data organized by game entity type

## Import Conventions

- Use `@/` path alias for `src/` directory
- Group imports: external libraries, internal modules, relative imports
- Prefer named exports over default exports for utilities

# Key Principles

- **Data Accuracy**: Precise character stats and skill descriptions are critical
- **Performance**: Fast loading and responsive design for mobile gaming scenarios
- **Accessibility**: Clean, intuitive interface that works well on mobile devices
- **Community-Driven**: Open source project welcoming contributions from the gaming community
- **Compatibility**: Ensure backward compatibility of import characters function in EditMode

# Reply Rules

## Reply style

- Be concise! Eliminate filler words.

## Comment Edit Rules

- Use meaningful variable/function names over comments
- Add comments only for: complex logic, non-obvious algorithms, or public APIs

## Command Line Syntax

- Use PowerShell syntax: `;` instead of `&&`, etc.

# Code Standards

- Follow existing patterns
- Ensure TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Write features with least net code increase
- Avoid inline scripts/styles and use build-time bundling for CSP compliance (though not required)
- Evaluate the code to ensure best practices before and after editing
- Optimize for static delivery and client-side hydration

# Things to do After Editing (important!)

- Run these commands to ensure code quality:

```Powershell
npm run lint            # Run ESLint
npm run type-check      # TypeScript type checking
```

- Write a draft commit message with `feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|chore(scope): ...` as a reference.
